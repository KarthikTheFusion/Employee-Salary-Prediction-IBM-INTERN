# Employee-Salary-Prediction-IBM-INTERN

💼 Employee Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning
📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict employee salaries based on various attributes such as job role, education, experience, company size, and location. Salary prediction is a common real-world problem in HR analytics and business intelligence, helping companies make informed decisions related to compensation planning, recruitment, and workforce strategy.

The solution is implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook and covers the entire machine learning workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation and final prediction.

🎯 Objectives
Understand the relationship between employee features and salary.

Apply machine learning models to predict salaries accurately.

Evaluate and compare model performance using standard regression metrics.

🧠 What the Project Covers
Data Cleaning: Handling missing/null values, dropping irrelevant columns.

Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Correlation heatmaps, box plots, and distributions to uncover data insights.

Model Training:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance using GridSearchCV or manual tuning.

Evaluation: Using R² Score, MAE, and RMSE to judge accuracy.

Prediction: Final model is used to predict salaries for new/unseen data.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy – data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – data visualization

Scikit-learn – ML models and metrics

Jupyter Notebook – development environment

📈 Outcome
The trained model can estimate salaries with reasonable accuracy and serves as a useful tool for salary benchmarking. It also showcases the application of regression techniques in real-world HR analytics.
